Health is priceless. I loved food in my normal life, did not like to sleep, and I rushed to answer emails every night after I got home, after I got really sick, then I realized that once people lose their health, they have nothing. Young people should ensure that sleep, stress, exercise, diet and other four points to achieve the premise of passing, and then work hard. Everything is done for a reason. Think of it as a learning opportunity, just as you would think of a disaster as a cause rather than an effect. Cherish the destiny, learn to be grateful and love. Learn how to live and live in the moment. Avoid some temptations. Although I thought I was on the right path, but the excessive pursuit of fame made me stray from my original intention. In the first tweet I posted after I got cancer, I said that everyone is equal in front of cancer. However, after I slowly awakened, I realized that everyone is equal in everything. Who are we to say that someone is an ordinary person, someone is not good, or a business will not succeed? What is life all about? If this life is used to experience, to learn, to improve, I believe it will also make the world a better place. Then the whole world and the whole human community will become more positive.

Time flies, without notice I have been working for fifteen years since graduated. The cloud computing has become very popular now, so most of the posts in my old blog are outdated, and it has been a long time since I updated it. Two years ago, to break the bottleneck of my development and take it to the next level in my future career, I went back to university for a master degree, then I have gained a new life in preparing for the exams and pursuing my studiesüòÑ, and also renewed the confidence and enthusiasm for learning, the courage to explore the unknown, and an ever-increasing belief in a better future. Therefore, I decided to start over and write a new blog to document the growth of this new phase of my life.
