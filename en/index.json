Instead the rich make the money work for them. Asset = puts money in your pocket (Generate money) Liability = takes money out of your pocket (Cost you money) Pay Yourself First To pay yourself first means allocating your money to the assets column, before paying your monthly expenses and bills. Business vs Job Keep your daytime job but start buying real assets: Businesses that do not require your presence Invest in stocks, bonds, real estate The Most Important Asset Your mind is your greatest asset, so be careful what you put into it. Actively seek out ways to grow your knowledge about money and managing your finances. Increase your financial literacy. As Warren Buffett said, “The most important investment you can make is in yourself.” What is Your Reason? Underlying everything that we do, there is a fundamental need we are trying to fulfil. As with anything in life, you don’t have a strong enough “why” it makes the process difficult when you are faced with setbacks. Your reason or purpose is usually a mix of “wants” and “don’t wants”. “I don’t want to work my entire life and be stuck in the rat race.” “I don’t want to live paycheck to paycheck.” “I want control over my time and my life. I want to make money work for me so I can be free and travel the world with my loved ones.” “I want control over my time and my life.” Dig deeper and ask yourself these questions. “What does being financially free means to me?” “Why is it so important for me to gain financial independence?” Your purpose lies somewhere in these answers. 5 Key Takeaways To recap, here are the five key main points: Make money work for you by Investing Always Pay Yourself First Know the difference between your Business and your Job Your Mind is the Most Important Asset Find your reason for financial independence Among all these 5 takeaways, the last one is the most important. Find your personal reason and understand why it is important for you to “gain financial freedom”. If you gain clarity on your why, you’ll naturally get to the how. Your journey starts with this step.

You have to know capital theory, what interest rates are, how resources are coordinated, etc. Many people do not have the time to learn all of this. Peter Schiff’s book tries to take these complicated theories and teaches his readers through a short story about the progression of a small island economy. Peter’s book is an updated version of his father’s book How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn’t by adding recent events and characters to the story. The book introduces us to a little bit of history of the science of economics in the last hundred years. Peter talks about the early Austrians and the rise of Keynesianism in the 1930s as a counter to the Great Depression. Keynesianism became the dominant paradigm and has plagued economics and the world since. Once Upon a Time The story starts with three islanders – Able, Baker, and Charlie. They were in dire poverty. The only resource they can gather is fish, and only one per day since they are using their bare hands (just enough to survive in this story). Since they consumed everything they caught, there were no savings in case something bad had happened. But they wanted more for their lives than spending the entire day catching one fish. Able came up with an idea to create a fish catcher, but in order to create this device, he must sacrifice a day and become on the verge of starvation to try and produce this net since there are no savings. When he created this net, his productivity doubled as he is now able to catch two fish per day. Throughout the book, Peter slips in economic ideas by explaining what the islanders are doing and sums up these ideas at the end of each chapter. For example, when Able created the net, he had to sacrifice eating a fish for a day, which meant he underconsumed, in order to create a net, or a capital good. As the story progresses, as there are now savings thanks to Able’s invention of the net, economic expansion accelerates. Able is able to do more than just fish because he now has a net. As they continue to save and create capital goods, their lives become better. The story continues with the explanation of other economic theories, such as the interest rate and what they do, why banks are created, how trade expands, the division of labor, and finally, how governments inflate the currency and drive interest rates lower to create an economic boom with an inevitable crash. Epilogue The story ends and Peter shifts to the modern day, as he explains how the bursting of the dot-com bubble and George Bush and Alan Greenspan’s heavy intervention into the market has fueled the bubble for the housing bubble and created the crash. He continues to describe how the government, instead of learning from the lessons of the past, keeps trying the same thing that caused the last crisis. When Obama came to office, he did the same thing Bush did, which was to stimulate the economy in order to make it look good for re-election. So if you really want to understand the cause of recessions in an easy and fun manner, Peter Schiff’s book will tell you a good story.

NVC gives us the tools and consciousness to understand what triggers us, to take responsibility for our reactions, and to deepen our connection with ourselves and others, thereby transforming our habitual responses to life. Ultimately, it involves a radical change in how we think about life and meaning. NVC is based on a fundamental principle: Underlying all human actions are needs that people are seeking to meet, and understanding and acknowledging these needs can create a shared basis for connection, cooperation, and more globally – peace. NVC was developed by Dr. Marshall B. Rosenberg, who has introduced it to individuals and organizations world-wide. NVC has been used between warring tribes and in war-torn countries; in schools, prisons, and corporations; in health care, social change, and government institutions; and in intimate personal relationships. Currently, over 200 hundred certified trainers and many more non-certified trainers around the world are sharing NVC in their communities.

Both are expressed through four components – observations, feelings, needs, and requests. Four steps of Nonviolent Communication: observe, identify and state feelings, identify and state needs, and make requests. Observations: Observe what’s happening, what’s really going on? What is happening or being said that you either like or dislike? Feelings: Identify your feelings about it, anger, joy, hopeful, inspired, lonely? Needs: Figure out what need you have that is driving that feeling. Requests: Ask for what you need (explicitly). When you feel an emotional response to a situation, it’s always based on some unmet need. So figure out what that need is and then request (don’t demand) for the other person to fulfill it. Use phrases like: “Would you be willing to set the table?” rather than “Set the table.” Expressing our own observations, feelings, needs and requests to others is one part of NVC. The second part is empathy: the process of connecting with another by guessing their feelings and needs. When we use NVC to connect empathically, we use the same four components in the form of a question, since we can never know what is going on inside the other. The other person will always be the ultimate authority on what is going on for them. Our empathy may meet other people’s needs for understanding, or it may spark their own self-discovery. We may ask something like: When you [see, hear, etc…] …. Are you feeling ….. Because you need ….. And would you like …..?

Leading life with respect, understanding, appreciation, gratitude, compassion and friendship, rather than selfishness, greed, hatred, prejudice, suspicion and hostility. Nonviolent communication reminds us that listening to the different voices within, and the needs they reflect, can promote self-understanding and inner harmony. By developing a good communication through a pattern of observations, feelings, needs, and requests, it makes life more harmonious and beautiful.

Those free food samples at Costco aren’t so free after all. Contrast: Extreme positions make less extreme positions more palatable - You are more likely to spend $100 on a shirt if you already spent on a suit, and the good cop is more likely to win your confession after the bad cop has done his work. Commitment and Consistency Studies show that gamblers are more convinced of a horse’s capability to win after placing the bet versus before the bet. Placing a commitment causes more loyalty to an idea. People will defend a position once they take it - Competitions that ask you describe the virtues of a product in 15 words or less essentially convert you to promote positive messages of that product to other people, since you will aim to be consistent with yourself. Social proof People will look to others to aid their decision-making process. If “people like you” claim to like an idea, chances are that you will too (hence canned laughter in TV shows). Liking You are more likely to accept an idea from a people you like. Studies show that attractive people have twice the likelihood of con vicing others than average-looking individuals, and salespeople are frequently trained to feign interest in your hobbies and mirror your body language for the same reason. Authority If those we respect take a position, we’re more convinced by its validity. From the sales frenzy over Sarah Palin’s glasses to the use of celebrities to endorse products, authority is a trump card in persuasion. Scarcity We are driven to ideas that seem scarce - Hence the use of the “Buy now, offer won’t last!” approach to sales, or the use of high prices to create exclusivity.

Part of her will always belong to the mountain back home, and another part of her is destined to fly like a bird to her own mountain. Education gives Tara a new perspective on how her family sees the world, a new view of her father’s gaslighting, her mother’s cowardice, and her brother Shawn’s violence. She courageously resisted her family’s opposition and obstacles to her education, grew in her education and freed herself from gaslighting. As Tara said: “You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.” ","date":"2022-01-16","objectID":"/en/2022/01/notes-from-reading-educated-a-memoir/:2:0","tags":["Biography"],"title":"Notes from reading 'Educated: A Memoir'","uri":"/en/2022/01/notes-from-reading-educated-a-memoir/"},{"categories":["Notes"],"content":"Thinking Tara’s experience was full of trauma and struggle. Putting those feelings aside, I prefer to get some energy from a positive perspective as the following. The power of role models Tara’s older brother, Tyler, was the first child who left home, went to university and got his Ph.D. He proved himself, enlightened and encouraged Tara to enter the universitry. He is a role model for Tara. Tara’s other brother, Richard, also stepped into university after her and got his Ph.D. In a family with seven children, three have PhDs, while the other four didn’t even go to high school. It is the power of role models. The wealth of suffering Tara’s hardships were instead transformed into an asset, valuable material for her dissertation research, which won her professors’ favor and led to her subsequent legendary experiences at Cambridge and Harvard. The warmth of human kindness Her father’s gaslighting, her mother’s cowardice, and her brother Shawn’s violence were not the whole story of Tara’s life. The love of her grandmother, the concern of her mother, and the encouragement of her brother Tyler brought warmth and hope to her life. The friendliness of her classmates, the concern of her friends, the financial support from her church, and the attentive care of her professors were also all blessings for Tara to be thankful for. I will keep such a positive perspective, gain strength from role models, turn hardships into wealth, feel and be grateful for the warmth of human kindness, keep learning to be educated, and fly as a bird to my mountain.

Togetherness Sharing food nurtures more than our physical body. It feeds our friendships, bolsters our bonds, and nourishes our sense of community. Creating common areas for the community encourages social interactions and impromptu conversations between residents. If you think back to a time you felt happy - a time you felt good, laughed, or smiled, chances are you were together with other people. The happiness tip is to make the effort to speak to your neighbours, meet them for coffee, help them in the shared garden, or just stop to chat next time you see them. Money Lack of money is a cause of unhappiness. Take time to enjoy the journey towards your goal, but also understand that achieving your goal will not fulfill you completely. We continuously raise the bar for what we want or what we need to feel happy. There is no single thing that will quench our ambitions forever. Focus on the journey, not the destination. Health Health is wealth. Good health allows us to play, enjoy life, and seek adventures. Freedom Life is defined by time. Time is a finite, non-replenishable, and perishable resource. It is also the only resource that is granted to all humans evenly. Three key areas have an impact on how you spend your time: work, family/relationships, and commute. Trust People who trust other people are happier. When there is trust, you don’t need to write up a contract for every simple transaction, a deal is a deal, and your word is your word. If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember everything. Kindness Find ways you can volunteer to help others. Improve your community and develop your sense of purpose. Smile and chat with strangers. Hand out smiles and friendly remarks. They are free. Learn the name of someone you see every day. Greet that person by name. Talk to the shy person who’s by themselves at a party or the office. Give someone a genuine compliment.

Here is a summary of some key points from the book: Anyone can improve through focus and effective practice. If you are not improving, that’s because you are not practicing in the correct way. 3F rules: Focus. Feedback. Fix it: i.e. You need to identify what’s the exact nature of the skill you want to learn, who’s mastering that, and what practice made it happen. Then break down that skill into small pieces, and design the ways suitable for your situation to enhance that. While continuing training, you need to monitor your performance(or have experienced teacher do that for you), get feedback about your weakness, and then revise training to specifically address them. Building mental representations are all about observing experts’ performance, spotting the difference between yours and theirs, and finding ways to minimize that difference. That’s not about what you know, but about how you are trying to do and modifying things. At the beginning, IQ and talents can get you start quickly. However, in the long run, it’s ones who practice more who prevails, not ones who had some advantage in intelligence or some other talents. In order to develop skill, you need to put in many hours of practice, typically hundreds or thousands of hours of practice over the course of many years. There are no shortcuts. To be effective, practice needs to be “deliberate”, which means working with a skilled coach, focusing on development of fundamental skills in the early stages of learning, giving full attention and concentration during the practice, continually stretching beyond comfort zones (which means the practice isn’t fun, so a key challenge is maintaining motivation), setting short-term goals, evolving the practice based on monitoring of performance, and continually refining mental models to make them more sophisticated and extensive.

I will keep learning as a lifelong learner and keep practicing deliberately to make life full of possibilities😁.

During the competition, colleagues kept showing their stage results in the group, and they all did feature engineering. So I also searched the articles in this area and finally completed successfully with the recognition rate over 99%. The main processes are as follows. 1.Collect samples Only 100 sample CAPTCHAs were provided to all participants in this CAPTCHA recognition contest. 2.Feature engineering Using the OpenCV library to analyze the CAPTCHA samples, remove the noise such as various random lines, and highlight the characters in the CAPTCHA such as 5UFQ. 3.Manual labeling Manually recognize and rename each original CAPTCHA as its characters such as 5UFQ.jpg, then cut the CAPTCHAs into individual character images after feature engineering and saved as: 5UFQ_5.jpg, 5UFQ_U.jpg, 5UFQ_F.jpg, 5UFQ_Q.jpg. 4.Train the model Use the above images with single characters as training set, and the characters of each image as labels, build a mapping table of images to labels. Perform the OpenCV’s built-in KNN similarity model for Machine learning, to train a model that can recognize similar CAPTCHAs. 5.Recognition Use some original CAPTCHAs samples as the test dataset, remove the noise by feature engineering, then use the trained model to recognize them and save the results in a CSV file.

Code Management Do the Code Review, push the codes to GitLab, and GitLab will automatically trigger the related Jenkins jobs to do the Code Analysis, Build and Unit Test, then deploy the packages to Nexus repository. Artifact Management Automatically scan the packages in Nexus with Nessus. Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code Check whether the required infrastructure is ready or not, if not ready, create the infrastructure as code automatically, then deploy the packages and configurations to the servers or Kubernetes clusters. Integration Tests and Security Tests Scan the applications with security tools and test the availability. Audit and Approval Audit the whole pipeline and wait for the manual review, when the release manager approved, automatically continue to run the deployment and integration tests in staging environment, then wait for another review and approval for the production release.

This course is the basis for the book “The Willpower Instinct”. Because I can’t stand my own procrastination and laziness, I have tried various methods to change, including making lists, writing plans, self-reflection, painful resolutions, and reading chicken soup, but I still repeatedly fall into degradation, leading to inner torment. I used to think that lack of self-control was just a psychological problem and a personality flaw. After reading the book “The Willpower Instinct”, I realized that the lack of self-control is not only a psychological problem, but also influenced by physiology, psychological traps and various social factors. As I read, I followed the examples, questions and action suggestions in the book to dissect my past habits and failures. I also got to know myself in a more scientific perspective and reconciled with myself, also learned some scientific and effective ways to improve my self-control.

We used to look for ways to correct and improve our self-control, but we neglected why we can’t control ourselves. This is a course that deals with psychology, physiology and even economics, and it gives a lot of good explanations for the problem of willpower. The book mentions many ways to enhance willpower, there is a good summary from a user on Douban, as follows. 1. Usual practice Focused breathing is a simple and effective meditation technique. Exercise is the way to restore physical fitness and willpower. Make sure your body has an adequate supply of food, which will give your brain more sustained energy. Consistent self-control in the little things will improve overall willpower. 2. Timely adjustment of physical and mental state A quick way to improve willpower: slow down your breathing and take 4-6 deep breaths per minute. A 5-minute “green workout” can reduce stress, get out of the office, find the nearest piece of green space, breathe fresh air and do some simple stretching activities. Effective ways to relieve stress. Exercise or participate in sports, pray or attend religious services, read, listen to music, spend time with friends, get a massage, go for a walk, meditate or yoga, and develop other creative hobbies. 3. Advance preparation after setting a goal 6-7 hours of sleep per day. Do the hardest things when your willpower is strongest, usually in the morning. Predict how you will be tempted and break promises in the process of achieving your goals, and imagine what you should do then to not give up. Put pressure on your future self by making medical appointments, buying an annual gym pass, going out shopping with only cash, putting your alarm clock at the other end of the room, etc. Imagine a better picture of the future. Write a letter to your future self. Describe to your future self what you will do now. Imagine that your future self will feel grateful for what your present self has done. Imagine the self you wish to be and the self you fear to be in a specific scenario, and then compare and contrast. To avoid repeating the mistakes of others who have lost their self-control, take a moment at the beginning of each day to think about your goals. Find a “group” to join that shares your goals. Being in such a group will make you feel that your goals are the social norm. Find someone close to you to be a role model for your willpower. 4. Facing temptation The “willpower muscle” can last longer with the right motivation. Tell yourself, “A lot of things that are hard now will become easy.” There is no difference between tomorrow and today. Tell yourself, “Do you really believe that you can eat this piece of fried chicken today and stick to your veggies all day tomorrow? Do you really believe you won’t study today but you’ll make up for it tomorrow? Don’t lie to yourself!” When expecting to get what tempts you, tell yourself the reality: “When you really go to ……, you’ll find it’s not as happy as you thought!” When you find yourself using the effort you’ve made as an excuse to indulge, tell yourself, “Because I ate vegetarian all day yesterday, so I can reward myself with a McDonald’s today. This is not the right logic. It should be: I ate vegetarian yesterday for the goal of losing weight, and I should do the same today.” Schedule a 10-minute waiting period in front of all temptations. If after 10 minutes you still want it, you can have it. But within the 10 minutes, you must always resist the temptation by thinking about the real goal. If possible, create some physical distance away from the temptation. When you are tempted to decide to do something that is contrary to your long-term interests, imagine that you have already achieved your ultimate goal. Then seriously ask yourself, “Have you really decided to give up your goal of losing weight for the meat in front of you?” Think what you think and fol","date":"2021-11-06","objectID":"/en/2021/11/notes-from-reading-the-willpower-instinct/:2:0","tags":["Psychology","Self-management"],"title":"Notes from reading 'The Willpower Instinct'","uri":"/en/2021/11/notes-from-reading-the-willpower-instinct/"},{"categories":["Notes"],"content":"Thinking While reading this book, I was surprised many times by the various conclusions analyzed from a physiological point of view, and gained many scientific and practical ways to enhance my willpower.

Health is priceless. I loved food in my normal life, did not like to sleep, and I rushed to answer emails every night after I got home, after I got really sick, then I realized that once people lose their health, they have nothing. Young people should work hard only after ensuring that sleep, stress, exercise and diet meet the basic requirements. Everything is done for a reason. Think of it as a learning opportunity, just as you would think of a disaster as a cause rather than an effect. Cherish the destiny, learn to be grateful and love. Learn how to live and live in the moment. Avoid some temptations. Although I thought I was on the right path, but the excessive pursuit of fame made me stray from my original intention. In the first tweet I posted after I got cancer, I said that everyone is equal in front of cancer. However, after I slowly awakened, I realized that everyone is equal in everything. Who are we to say that someone is an ordinary person, someone is not good, or a business will not succeed? What is life all about? If this life is used to experience, to learn, to improve, I believe it will also make the world a better place. Then the whole world and the whole human community will become more positive.
