Here is a summary of some key points from the book: Anyone can improve through focus and effective practice. If you are not improving, that‚Äôs because you are not practicing in the correct way. 3F rules: Focus. Feedback. Fix it: i.e. You need to identify what‚Äôs the exact nature of the skill you want to learn, who‚Äôs mastering that, and what practice made it happen. Then break down that skill into small pieces, and design the ways suitable for your situation to enhance that. While continuing training, you need to monitor your performance(or have experienced teacher do that for you), get feedback about your weakness, and then revise training to specifically address them. Building mental representations are all about observing experts' performance, spotting the difference between yours and theirs, and finding ways to minimize that difference. That‚Äôs not about what you know, but about how you are trying to do and modifying things. At the beginning, IQ and talents can get you start quickly. However, in the long run, it‚Äôs ones who practice more who prevails, not ones who had some advantage in intelligence or some other talents. In order to develop skill, you need to put in many hours of practice, typically hundreds or thousands of hours of practice over the course of many years. There are no shortcuts. To be effective, practice needs to be ‚Äúdeliberate‚Äù, which means working with a skilled coach, focusing on development of fundamental skills in the early stages of learning, giving full attention and concentration during the practice, continually stretching beyond comfort zones (which means the practice isn‚Äôt fun, so a key challenge is maintaining motivation), setting short-term goals, evolving the practice based on monitoring of performance, and continually refining mental models to make them more sophisticated and extensive.

So I also searched the articles in this area and finally completed successfully with the recognition rate over 99%. The main processes are as follows. 1.Collect samples Only 100 sample CAPTCHAs were provided to all participants in this CAPTCHA recognition contest. 2.Feature engineering Using the OpenCV library to analyze the CAPTCHA samples, remove the noise such as various random lines, and highlight the characters in the CAPTCHA such as 5UFQ. 3.Manual labeling Manually recognize and rename each original CAPTCHA as its characters such as 5UFQ.jpg, then cut the CAPTCHAs into individual character images after feature engineering and saved as: 5UFQ_5.jpg, 5UFQ_U.jpg, 5UFQ_F.jpg, 5UFQ_Q.jpg. 4.Train the model Use the above images with single characters as training set, and the characters of each image as labels, build a mapping table of images to labels. Perform the OpenCV‚Äôs built-in KNN similarity model for Machine learning, to train a model that can recognize similar CAPTCHAs. 5.Recognition Use some original CAPTCHAs samples as the test dataset, remove the noise by feature engineering, then use the trained model to recognize them and save the results in a CSV file.

It includes all necessary steps, across three different environments, with the most popular automation tools and Cloud services, including the infrastructure as code and configurations as code, integrates with security tools, with the manual approve function based on the tests and security reports. It includes the following items: Project Management Think about a story, document it on Confluence and create tasks on JIRA, integrate JIRA with GitLab. Code Management Do the Code Review, push the codes to GitLab, and GitLab will automatically trigger the related Jenkins jobs to do the Code Analysis, Build and Unit Test, then deploy the packages to Nexus repository. Artifact Management Automatically scan the packages in Nexus with Nessus. Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code Check whether the required infrastructure is ready or not, if not ready, create the infrastructure as code automatically, then deploy the packages and configurations to the servers or Kubernetes clusters. Integration Tests and Security Tests Scan the applications with security tools and test the availability. Audit and Approval Audit the whole pipeline and wait for the manual review, when the release manager approved, automatically continue to run the deployment and integration tests in staging environment, then wait for another review and approval for the production release. This DevSecOps CICD pipeline is more general and can balance security, audit, and the ability to take over existing on-premises infrastructure and services. For sure, there are differences in the most appropriate CICD pipelines in different environments, especially the toolchains, but the general process and thinking should be similar.

This course is the basis for the book ‚ÄúThe Willpower Instinct‚Äù. Because I can‚Äôt stand my own procrastination and laziness, I have tried various methods to change, including making lists, writing plans, self-reflection, painful resolutions, and reading chicken soup, but I still repeatedly fall into degradation, leading to inner torment. I used to think that lack of self-control was just a psychological problem and a personality flaw. After reading the book ‚ÄúThe Willpower Instinct‚Äù, I realized that the lack of self-control is not only a psychological problem, but also influenced by physiology, psychological traps and various social factors. As I read, I followed the examples, questions and action suggestions in the book to dissect my past habits and failures. I also got to know myself in a more scientific perspective and reconciled with myself, also learned some scientific and effective ways to improve my self-control.

We used to look for ways to correct and improve our self-control, but we neglected why we can‚Äôt control ourselves. This is a course that deals with psychology, physiology and even economics, and it gives a lot of good explanations for the problem of willpower. The book mentions many ways to enhance willpower, there is a good summary from a user on Douban, as follows. 1. Usual practice Focused breathing is a simple and effective meditation technique. Exercise is the way to restore physical fitness and willpower. Make sure your body has an adequate supply of food, which will give your brain more sustained energy. Consistent self-control in the little things will improve overall willpower. 2. Timely adjustment of physical and mental state A quick way to improve willpower: slow down your breathing and take 4-6 deep breaths per minute. A 5-minute ‚Äúgreen workout‚Äù can reduce stress, get out of the office, find the nearest piece of green space, breathe fresh air and do some simple stretching activities. Effective ways to relieve stress. Exercise or participate in sports, pray or attend religious services, read, listen to music, spend time with friends, get a massage, go for a walk, meditate or yoga, and develop other creative hobbies. 3. Advance preparation after setting a goal 6-7 hours of sleep per day. Do the hardest things when your willpower is strongest, usually in the morning. Predict how you will be tempted and break promises in the process of achieving your goals, and imagine what you should do then to not give up. Put pressure on your future self by making medical appointments, buying an annual gym pass, going out shopping with only cash, putting your alarm clock at the other end of the room, etc. Imagine a better picture of the future. Write a letter to your future self. Describe to your future self what you will do now. Imagine that your future self will feel grateful for what your present self has done. Imagine the self you wish to be and the self you fear to be in a specific scenario, and then compare and contrast. To avoid repeating the mistakes of others who have lost their self-control, take a moment at the beginning of each day to think about your goals. Find a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù to join that shares your goals. Being in such a group will make you feel that your goals are the social norm. Find someone close to you to be a role model for your willpower. 4. Facing temptation The ‚Äúwillpower muscle‚Äù can last longer with the right motivation. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúA lot of things that are hard now will become easy.‚Äù There is no difference between tomorrow and today. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúDo you really believe that you can eat this piece of fried chicken today and stick to your veggies all day tomorrow? Do you really believe you won‚Äôt study today but you‚Äôll make up for it tomorrow? Don‚Äôt lie to yourself!‚Äù When expecting to get what tempts you, tell yourself the reality: ‚ÄúWhen you really go to ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶, you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs not as happy as you thought!‚Äù When you find yourself using the effort you‚Äôve made as an excuse to indulge, tell yourself, ‚ÄúBecause I ate vegetarian all day yesterday, so I can reward myself with a McDonald‚Äôs today. This is not the right logic. It should be: I ate vegetarian yesterday for the goal of losing weight, and I should do the same today.‚Äù Schedule a 10-minute waiting period in front of all temptations. If after 10 minutes you still want it, you can have it. But within the 10 minutes, you must always resist the temptation by thinking about the real goal. If possible, create some physical distance away from the temptation. When you are tempted to decide to do something that is contrary to your long-term interests, imagine that you have already achieved your ultimate goal. Then seriously ask yourself, ‚ÄúHave you really decided to give up your goal of losing weight for the meat in front of you?‚Äù Think what you think and fol","date":"2021-11-06","objectID":"/en/2021/11/notes-from-reading-the-willpower-instinct/:2:0","tags":["Psychology","Self-management"],"title":"Notes from reading 'The Willpower Instinct'","uri":"/en/2021/11/notes-from-reading-the-willpower-instinct/"},{"categories":["Notes"],"content":"Thinking While reading this book, I was surprised many times by the various conclusions analyzed from a physiological point of view, and gained many scientific and practical ways to enhance my willpower.

Health is priceless. I loved food in my normal life, did not like to sleep, and I rushed to answer emails every night after I got home, after I got really sick, then I realized that once people lose their health, they have nothing. Young people should work hard only after ensuring that sleep, stress, exercise and diet meet the basic requirements. Everything is done for a reason. Think of it as a learning opportunity, just as you would think of a disaster as a cause rather than an effect. Cherish the destiny, learn to be grateful and love. Learn how to live and live in the moment. Avoid some temptations. Although I thought I was on the right path, but the excessive pursuit of fame made me stray from my original intention. In the first tweet I posted after I got cancer, I said that everyone is equal in front of cancer. However, after I slowly awakened, I realized that everyone is equal in everything. Who are we to say that someone is an ordinary person, someone is not good, or a business will not succeed? What is life all about? If this life is used to experience, to learn, to improve, I believe it will also make the world a better place. Then the whole world and the whole human community will become more positive.
