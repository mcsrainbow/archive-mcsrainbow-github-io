## Be open-minded

Be not afraid. Do it best. Keep doing and stop worrying about results.

## Love and Happiness

When parents alive, we know where we came from.

But if parents passed away, the only way we have left in our life towards the death.

Love my parents, love my wife's parents.

Love my wife, love our children.

Love myself, love our relatives and friends.
