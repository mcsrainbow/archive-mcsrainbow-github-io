# Life is Short and Love is Long


The rest of life is precious and unpredictable, don't let the regrets be too long.

## Be open-minded

Be not afraid. Do it best. Keep doing and stop worrying about results.

## Love and Happiness

When parents are alive, we know where we came from.

When parents are gone, the only way we have left in our life towards the death.

Love my parents, love my wife's parents.

Love my wife, love our children.

Love myself, love our relatives and friends.
