## Preface

Robert Kiyosaki had two fathers: a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated with a Ph.D. and so intelligent he completed his undergraduate degree in only two years. The other father didn’t even finish the eighth grade. While both men worked hard, were successful, and earned a lot of money, there was always one who struggled with money. And the other dad, well, he became one of the richest people in Hawaii. 

Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert Kiyosaki’s best-selling book about the difference in mindset between the poor, middle class, and rich.

## Thinking

"The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets."

"The rich don’t work for money. They make money work for them."

These two statements were enlightening to me. And the phrase "Rat Race" made me realize the reality of my current situation.

With this book, I have started to learn about finance and try to get out of the "Rat Race" dilemma.
