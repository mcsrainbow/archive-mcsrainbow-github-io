A multi-cloud strategy allows companies to select different cloud services from different providers.

<!--more-->

## Reasons

A multi-cloud strategy allows companies to select different cloud services from different providers, implement a multi-cloud environment for the following reasons:

+ Choice
  
  Multi-cloud infrastructure can combine the best services that each platform offers, thereby optimizing returns on cloud investments, gives flexibility and the ability to avoid vendor lock-in.

+ Disaster Avoidance
  
  As proverb that says donâ€™t put all of your eggs in the same basket. If one vendor happens to have infrastructure meltdown, attack or geopolitical risks, can quickly switch to another cloud service provider.

+ Compliance
  
  Multi-cloud environments can help enterprises achieve the goals for governance, risk management and compliance regulations.

## Architecture

After investigated many multi-cloud platforms from different companies, then I found the following diagram of **Fully Functional Multi-Cloud Management Platform Architecture** from [[OpsAny]^(Make Ops Perfect)](https://www.opsany.com).

It shows the various service modules which need to be considered in a multi-cloud architecture, and it is easy to see that there are many difficulties and challenges in building a multi-cloud management platform.
