## Preface

Having served as a top manager at top technology companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google, Kai-Fu Lee is known as a life winner and has a significant influence on the post-80s generation.

After being diagnosed with lymphoma, he gained a new understanding and appreciation of life. The book "Living to Die: The Death Credit I Took" is a true reproduction of what Kai-Fu Lee thought during his illness, and it shows his personality and values after his rebirth.

At the launch of the book, Kai-Fu Lee summarized his insights into the seven death credits for remediation.

1. Health is priceless. I love food in ordinary life, do not love to sleep, every night back to rush back to the mailbox, really sick after deeply appreciate, health lost is what is no longer. Young people should be in the protection of sleep, stress, exercise, diet four points to reach the premise of passing, to work hard.
2. Everything is done for a reason. It's like treating disasters as thus non-fruits and as learning opportunities.
3. Cherish the destiny, learn to be grateful and love.
4. Learn how to live and live in the moment.
5. Avoid some temptations. Although I thought I was on the right path, but the excessive pursuit of fame made me stray from my original intention.
6. All people are equal, treat everyone well. The first tweet I sent when I got cancer: Everyone is equal before cancer. However, after I slowly awakened, I found that everyone is equal in everything. Who are we to say that someone is an ordinary person, someone is not good, or a business will not succeed?
7. What is life all about? We only live once, we die and leave this world, if this life is to experience, learn and improve, I believe it will also make this world a better place. Then the whole world, the whole group will become more positive.

I also followed his personal experience and felt what it was like to walk through the valley of the shadow of death and taste the nectar of life, and awakened myself to the fact that I immediately began to pay attention to my health and family, and have already taken action and benefited greatly.
