I have renewed the confidence and enthusiasm for learning, the courage to explore the unknown, and an ever-increasing belief in a better future.

## Why start over

It was not on a whim or impulse that I made up my mind to close my old blog and start writing a new one.

Time flies, without notice I have been working for fifteen years since graduated.

The cloud computing has become very popular now, so most of the posts in my old blog are outdated, and it has been a long time since I updated it.

Two years ago, to break the bottleneck of my development and take it to the next level in my future career, I went back to university for a master degree, then I have gained a new life in preparing for the exams and pursuing my studies:smile:, and also renewed the confidence and enthusiasm for learning, the courage to explore the unknown, and an ever-increasing belief in a better future.

Therefore, I decided to start over and write a new blog to document the growth of this new phase of my life.
