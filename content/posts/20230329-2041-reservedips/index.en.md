In the Internet addressing architecture, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) have reserved various IP addresses for special purposes.

## Misunderstandings about Private IP Addresses

The concepts of internal and external IP addresses are not fixed, but relative. It's easier to understand them as private and public IP addresses or local area network and internet IP addresses.

Almost all textbooks tell us that there are three types of private IP addresses:

+  Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
+  Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
+  Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

But in fact, private IP addresses are more than these. From the Wikipedia page [Reserved IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses), in the Internet addressing architecture, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) have reserved various IP addresses for special purposes.

## List of Reserved IPv4 Addresses

The IPv4 addresses are shown below:


| Address block CIDR | Address range                 | Number of addresses | Scope           | RFC             | Description             |
