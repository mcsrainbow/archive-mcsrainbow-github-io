## Be Open-minded

Be not afraid. Do it best. Keep doing and stop worrying about results.

## Be Positive

Get out and get some exercise! You'll be back in full spirit!

Focus now! You'll experience the happiness of flow!

Keep it tidy and clean! You'll be easeful and clear!

## Love and Happiness

When parents are alive, we know where we came from.

When parents are gone, the only way we have left in our life towards the death.

Love my parents, love my wife's parents.

Love my wife, love our children.

Love myself, love our relatives and friends.
